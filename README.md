# HTB-Writeups

Dear Kind Reader,

Welcome to my first {proper} github repo where I will create writeups for
machines I attempt on the www.HackTheBox.com platform. Don't come here expecting
to see world-class hacking - yet ;) - this is more of a pet project done to help
document and solidify my learning when using git and HTB. Thanks for reading!

\- James
